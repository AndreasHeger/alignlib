\section intro_sec Introduction

Alignlib is a C++ library for computing and manipulating sequence alignments of protein sequences. 
It implements sequence-sequence, sequence-profile and profile-profile alignment. Most of the functions
and classes are exported to python thus permitting easy scripting of complex tasks.

\subsection download_sec Download

Alignlib is hosted by <a href="http://alignlib.wiki.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.

\subsubsection tar_sec Installation from sources

The latest source can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=207728"> download section</a> 
on sourceforge.

\subsubsection svn_sec Development Version from subversion

The development version can be obtained using subversion. Subversion
is freely available from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">here</a>.

<pre>
svn --username=USERNAME co https://alignlib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alignlib/trunk alignlib
</pre>

Next, configure the library for compilation:

\code
cd alignlib
autoreconf --install
\endcode

\subsection Requirements

Alignlib requires the freely available <a href="http://www.boost.org">boost</a> c++ library.

Alignlib uses <a href="http://www.language-binding.net/pyplusplus/pyplusplus.html">Py++</a> to
generate python bindings to the library. Py++ in turn depends on 
<a href="http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html">gccxml</a> and 
<a href="http://www.language-binding.net/pygccxml/pygccxml.html">pygccxml</a>. These libraries
are required for development, but should not be necessary for compiling the python bindings.
Boost.python should suffice.

The library has been tested with

<table>
<tr>   
<td>gcc</td><td>3.2.3, 4.1.2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>gccxml</td><td>0.7.0</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>pygccxml</td><td>0.9</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>py++</td><td>0.9</td>
</tr>
</table>
   
\subsection install_c++_sec C++ library

The library uses the standard gnu build tools. Building the library should
be straight-forward on most systems where these tools are installed. The library
is built using the usual sequence of commands:

\code
./configure
make
make install
\endcode

\subsection install_python_sec Python interface

The python extension to alignlib is built using boost.python. The script
\em setup.py will take care of compilation and installation. Make sure 
that the environment variables \em BOOST_BUILD_PATH and \em BOOST_ROOT are set.

To build, type
\code
cd python
python setup.py build
\endcode
 
To install, type
\code
python setup.py install
\endcode

\section history_sec History

Alignlib has evolved out of code used written by me, 
<a href="http::wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/~andreas">Andreas Heger</a>,
during my PhD. This explains the bias in the library towards 
protein sequences and protein sequence alignment algorithms. It also 
explains the sometimes strange choice of algorithms. 

Alignlib was started in 2000 and has evolved every since.

Alignlib is freely available under the GNU Public Licence.

\section disclaimer_sec Disclaimer

I have learned much from reading and using publicly available code. Some of it 
will have found its way in alignlib. During my research I also 
had to implement ideas of others - for benchmarking purposes or to 
better understand an algorithm. 

My aim is to attribute algorithms and ideas correctly, even though 
the annotation of the code is far from complete. Please let me know
if you think your copyright has been violated or your authorship has 
not been acknowledged.
